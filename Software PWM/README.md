# Software PWM
An LED is turn on at 50% duty cycle to begin. Pressing the button increases the duty cycle of the PWM signal, increasing its brightness. A second LED lights up when the button is pressed as well. When the button is pressed when the brightness is at 100%, it goes to zero brightness. Button debouncing is used to ensure each button press is accounted for exactly once.

The LED and button pins can be changed with by chaning the #defines which defines generic names for GPIO registers and pins. The debounce threshold is currently at 5ms and can be changed by changing the TCCR0A value. This value can be calculated by dividing the desired threshold in seconds by the CPU speed (currently 1 MHz).

The PWM signal operates at 1 kHz. This can be changed by changing the TCCR1A value.

The PWM signal is generated by manually turning on and off the pin in software. The turning on and off is regulated by timer1. Timer0 is used for the debouncing.

### Differences Between Implementation for each Processor
- The FR6989 needs the line `PM5CTL0 &= ~LOCKLPM5`, which disables the GPIO pins' default high impedance state
- The MSP-EXT430G2ET board (G2553 processor) includes a pullup resistor on the button. The MSP-EXP430FR6989 board does not. Therefore, the internal pullup resistor for the button gpio pin is enable in the FR6989 program.
